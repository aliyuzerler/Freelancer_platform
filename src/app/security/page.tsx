        <p>
          Freelancezero never holds your money and never takes a commission. Funds move directly
          between client and freelancer through the provider they choose. We store a display-only
          identifier for your chosen payout method (for example a PayPal email) — never full banking
          credentials or card numbers. That means there is no pot of user funds on our side to steal.
