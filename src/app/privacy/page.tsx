        <p>
          Freelancezero (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) operates a zero-fee freelance
          marketplace. This policy explains what we do with personal data when you use the hosted
          service at freelancezero.com. Freelancezero is also open source and self-hostable — if you
          are using someone else&rsquo;s instance, that operator is the data controller, not us.

          items={[
            'Account data: name, email address, password hash, and profile photo if you upload one.',
            'Profile data: headline, bio, skills, rates, portfolio items, and work history you choose to publish.',
            'Marketplace activity: job postings, proposals, messages, contracts, and reviews.',
            'Payout preferences: the payment method you select and a display-only identifier (for example a PayPal email). We never take custody of funds and we do not store full bank credentials.',
            'Technical data: audit-log entries for security-sensitive actions such as sign-in and payout changes. Audit logs are deliberately minimal — we do not store IP addresses or browser user agents alongside them.',

          items={[
            'To operate the marketplace: matching freelancers with jobs, delivering proposals, and enabling messaging.',
            'To send transactional email: email confirmation, sign-in links, application notifications, and security alerts.',
            'To keep the platform safe: preventing spam, fraud, and abuse, and reviewing accounts before approval.',

        <p>
          We do not sell your personal data, and we do not use it to train advertising profiles.

      </Section>

      <Section heading="Legal bases (GDPR)">
        <p>
          Where the GDPR applies, we process personal data under: performance of a contract (running
          your account and the marketplace), legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention,
          product improvement), consent (optional communications, which you can withdraw), and legal
          obligation (tax and compliance records).
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Sharing">
        <p>
          We share data only with processors that make the service work — our hosting provider, our
          database host, and our transactional email provider. They act on our instructions and are
          bound by contract. When you apply to a job, your name, profile, and proposal are shared
          with that client; that is the point of the platform.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section heading="Retention">
        <p>
          We keep account data while your account is open. When you delete your account we begin a
          grace period, after which personal data is erased or irreversibly anonymised. Records we
          are legally required to keep (for example, transaction ledgers) are retained for the
          statutory period.

            'Access and export: download your data, including your profile and portfolio.',
            'Rectification: correct anything inaccurate from your settings page.',
